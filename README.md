# My portfolio 2

This project consists of the code for my personal page, its second version, made with Vue 3 and tailwind. It is deployed on [fernandokoji.dev](https://fernandokoji.dev/).
You can run it locally if you want by cloning and running _npm install_.
The template for project was cloned from my other project [vue-project-template](https://github.com/Kojji/vue-project-template), which has uses the contents below.

| Contents       |
| -------------- |
| Vue 3          |
| Vite           |
| Vue Router     |
| Vuex           |
| Cypress        |

Due to the simplicity of this project, Cypress was not used, and to comply with my needs, i18n, headlessui and GSAP were set up separetly from the initial template.
